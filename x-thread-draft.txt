AI agents are everywhere now.
But most can't touch money — because the moment they do, it gets messy fast.

So we built Klaude Suite: a Smart Safe for your OpenClaw agent on Solana.

2/
The simple problem:
An agent that can email, book, and run commands is useful.

An agent that can trade is a liability.
Not because AI is "bad" — because execution without guardrails is how people get wrecked.

3/
We're in an era where "install a skill, run a command" is normal.

That's exactly why security and limits have to be the default posture — not an afterthought.

4/
Klaude's rule is dead simple:

Your agent proposes.
The Smart Safe disposes.

No trade goes through unless it passes every rule you set.

5/
How it plugs in:

OpenClaw runs a local Gateway (loopback-first, default port 18789).
Klaude runs alongside it:
- Backend (scanner + paper engine + rules)
- Frontend (dashboard + manual overrides)

6/
Klaude gives your agent four modes:

Conservative — alerts + manual only
Moderate — only obvious setups
Aggressive — hunts more often
Degen — new launches + fast exits (still paper-first)

Same brain, different leash.

7/
The Smart Safe enforces hard limits:

- Max trade size
- Daily spend cap
- Slippage cap

Not suggestions. Hard stops.
If your agent tries to break a rule, it gets blocked and logged.

8/
Every token gets a risk label before the agent acts:

Safe / Risky / Danger

Based on liquidity, holders, and market cap thresholds.

You can filter by mode — or let everything through in degen, but with labels always visible.

9/
The "secret sauce" is boring on purpose:

Paper trading sandbox
Full portfolio tracking (entries, exits, partials, P&L)
Persists to SQLite so it survives restarts
You can reset and run it again

You watch it learn without lighting money on fire.

10/
Decisions come from one of two paths:

With an API key: LLM returns buy/skip/watch + confidence + size
Without: rule-based scoring (liquidity, age, momentum, etc.)

Either way — limits still win.

11/
You also get automated position management:

- Profit-taking ladders (2x / 5x / 10x milestones)
- Stop-loss logic
- "Dead token" detection
- Live activity feed + pause button

Stop the whole system instantly if vibes are off.

12/
Klaude Suite is for people who want the fun part of autonomous trading — without the "oops my agent nuked my wallet" part.

Paper trading only. No real funds. Not financial advice.

PINNED POST VERSION (single tweet):

AI agents can finally do real work — but the second they touch money, it's chaos.

Klaude Suite = a Smart Safe for OpenClaw on Solana: paper-trades tokens, scores risk, enforces hard limits, and logs every decision.

Your agent proposes. The Safe disposes.

Reply "KLAUDE" for the demo.
